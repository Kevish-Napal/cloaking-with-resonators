# Cloaking with Resonators

This repository contains Julia code that simulates the acoustic cloaking of objects using randomly oriented resonator layers. The simulations are based on multiple scattering theory and make use of the MultipleScattering.jl library. The goal is to investigate how resonator-based metamaterials can distort or hide the scattered signature of a target, making it undetectable or unrecognizable to radar- or sonar-like detection systems. The code supports statistical analysis over randomized cloaking configurations and compares resonators with simpler scatterers.

This research was funded by DSTL (Defence Science and Technology Laboratory) and carried out as part of a collaborative internship. A detailed report of the methodology and findings is available in the [final report](https://kevish-napal.github.io/assets/pdf/SummerInternship.pdf).
